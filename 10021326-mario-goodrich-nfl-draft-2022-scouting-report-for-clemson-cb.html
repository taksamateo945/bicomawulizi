He likes to get his hands on the receiver to reroute and disrupt the timing of routes. Though he has shown to play from a backpedal, he more often than not plays from an open shuffle technique, which better fits his skill set. An above-average athlete who displays rigid movement at times, Goodrich struggles with hip tightness and the ability to turn and run. Although he does a good job of getting out of breaks with clean, quick transitions, he does this best when already open and with the route in front of him.</p><p>A smart player, he shows the understanding of routes and combinations, especially when playing down and distance, leading him to play very aggressively when given over-the-top help. He also looks to sit on routes, which didn't particularly burn him during the 2021 season. Goodrich has the ball skills needed to compete, playing through the reception point and attacking the ball in the air, especially when playing short and medium routes. He struggles with routes developing downfield, as he has above-average top end speed. When running downfield, he tends to get handsy and overly physical, which can lead to penalties.</p><p>When playing the run game, Goodrich has shown quick reads and reaction to what he sees. He makes quick work of blockers, getting to the ball carrier with clear lanes and good leverage. Though he isn’t afraid of mixing it up in the run game, he often stops his feet on contact, choosing to wrap up and take the brunt of collisions.</p><p>Overall, Goodrich’s lack of speed downfield and subpar man-coverage skills are the kryptonite in his pass coverage game. Because of this, he would best fit a zone scheme where he will be given help over the top and be allowed to play routes with eyes on the quarterback. Goodrich is a potential role player with the ability to compete for a starter role a few years into his career.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 6.5 (4th Round- Potential Role Player)</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Levi Wallace</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloYmaAc4KMppiroZ9itLC7w6ugnKBdo7OtecOrmJ%2BsXWd9c36MrJqoraSeu6h50Z6nqKqkYrOwvoyco56lo6S7bq%2FB</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sperm-whale-plastic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A Whale Washed Up On Shore Had 64 Pounds Of Plastic In Its Stomach</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-styles-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Styles Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-roger-miller-from-coronado-racist-husband-and-wife-from-linfield-christian-school-viral-on.html>Who Is Roger Miller From Coronado?
