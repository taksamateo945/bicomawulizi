During an interview with People Magazine, the star sat down with his co-star, Matt Damon, and the two discussed some of their favorite films.</p><p>During the chat, Bale revealed the first time that his in-laws watched one of his films was American Psycho, which was arguably his most controversial role ever. The film starred Christian as Patrick Bateman, a murderous upper-class yuppie living in New York during the 1980s.</p><p>When he first married Sibi, her mother asked her if he had done any famous films, and she told him American Psycho, so she borrowed the copy from her.</p><p>Damon immediately said, “Oh no, oh my god.” Bale recalled that Sibi’s mother didn’t understand just how many crazy moments there would be in the film.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5A72f_lzaC/</p><p>Sibi and her grandmother ended up skipping through some of the more “inappropriate” parts of the film, thinking it was just an avant-garde scene for the sake of style, however, they ended up getting through the entire film in 15 minutes.</p><p>Bale, who starred as Patrick in the 2000 thriller, portrayed a high-strung and mentally disturbed man in his late twenties. While the movie has since become a massive cult-classic for Bale, it didn’t perform well at the box office.</p><p>Following the conclusion of the film, Sibi’s grandmother said to her that Christian must’ve not been a “proper actor,” and then hoped he would do much “better in the future.” These days, Bale’s roles haven’t been quite as controversial, including his recent box office success, Ford v Ferrari.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Bale admitted he was incredibly proud to star in Ford v Ferrari because there weren’t many films like it being made anymore. The actor added that it was the closest one could get to driving a race car without actually doing so. Damon added that it was definitely the type of movie that is better watched in the theater rather than on one’s phone.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTnb%2Bqv9OimKdlkpa5pnnRnq2emZyoerW0wK1koaGjYrSzrc2dpKismJq%2FbrXNZqOar6Nis6q%2B0q1kpqemnrJuwM5mrpqsk516sLKMoaCsZaeWwG6tzJ6popuRo3qxv9icn6hlY2mBc4GQaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dr-ira-woletsky-died.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dr. Ira Woletsky Died: Know More About Ira Woletsky?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-tonya-actor-sebastian-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I Tonya actor Sebastian ___</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-roger-miller-from-coronado-racist-husband-and-wife-from-linfield-christian-school-viral-on.html>Who Is Roger Miller From Coronado?
