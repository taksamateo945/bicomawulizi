At the young age of 23, <strong>Margot Robbie </strong>has quickly made a name for herself after taking on the role of Naomi Lapaglia, the wildly promiscuous wife of <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>'s Jordan Belfort</a> character in The Wolf of Wall Street. In a new interview with <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a>, the stunning Australian actress opened up about how she won the part, and why the sex scenes with DiCaprio were actually painful to film.</p><p>Earlier rumors claimed Robbie, who previously starred on ABC's now-cancelled Pan Am series, beat out <strong><a href=#>Jessica Biel</a> </strong>and <strong><a href=#>Kristen Stewart</a> </strong>for the coveted role opposite DiCaprio.</p><p>"I truly don't know to this day," Robbie told The Daily Beast. "I'm still completely confused, but extraordinarily grateful that I did [get the role]. I did a self-tape in L.A. that got sent to [casting director] Ellen Lewis that got sent to Marty, and then he asked to see me in a room so I could do an in-person audition with him and Leo, and then they brought me back a week later and gave me the role in the room."</p><p>Robbie said she had to rehearse some of the "hardest scenes" from the film for her audition in front of director <strong>Martin Scorsese </strong>and DiCaprio. "It was the throwing-water fight scene, the 'What's wrong, Daddy?' scene in the nursery — and a lot of it got cut out in the film," she revealed. "It was a lot more confronting and awkward to do in an audition, let me tell you. And I also did the first-date scene."</p><p>The awkwardness continued while filming, especially during a sex scene with DiCaprio on top of a pile of money.</p><p>"I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It's not as glamorous as it sounds," she shared. "If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don't. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, 'What is it?' And they said, 'You look like you've been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.'"</p><p>Robbie also had to bite her tongue to avoid embarrassing herself in front of Titanic heartthrob DiCaprio.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I was absolutely obsessed with Titanic — but not the movie, the actual boat," she said of her childhood. "I'd draw diagrams of it and everything and theorized that if it was built a different way, it wouldn't have sunk. But seeing the movie really traumatized me. It was the first sad movie I saw — when I was 8 years old — and it upset me so much I could never watch it again until two years ago."</p><p>"But, amongst my friends, everyone loves that movie," Robbie added of the 1997 film, which also starred <a href=#><strong>Kate Winslet</strong></a>. "It's a common quote among my friends and I that whenever it's cold, we go to each other, 'It's so cold, Jack. . .' I had to stop myself from saying it because I'd be on the set of Wolf of Wall Street shivering and I was tempted to go, 'It's so cold, Jack . . .' but Leo is there sitting right next to me."&nbsp;</p><p>Robbie will next appear in the <strong>Glenn Ficarra </strong>and<strong> John Requa</strong>-directed comedy Focus opposite <a href=#><strong>Will Smith</strong></a>. The film was originally set to star <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong></a> and <strong>Kristen Stewart</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOppirn5%2BperO7wZugnmWklrmsv4ywpqWeXaSzbsPApaNmq6SnsqbAjKycsWWjmLKvsdJmmK6cmam2sLrIp55mr5mptW64xKilmqqUpHqltcKap6uhn2J%2FcX2TcWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./153912-benefits-registering-a-business-south-africa-2023.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Benefits of registering a business in South Africa in 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./island-beach-party-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Island beach party</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-roger-miller-from-coronado-racist-husband-and-wife-from-linfield-christian-school-viral-on.html>Who Is Roger Miller From Coronado?
