Following his final NBA season in 2002-03, Kerr accepted his <a href=# rel=noopener>first</a> coaching job when he accepted the position with the Warriors in 2014 after three years in the Phoenix Suns front office.</p><p>The Lakers are now hoping Redick, bolstered by a roster built around Anthony Davis and potentially LeBron James, can make a similarly successful jump to the sideline this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqCc4SMpZiknaKoerPBzKiprGWan3qzscOimqRlmaPBpr7NmqOlsV2YvK68wKucnWWkpHq0wMSvnGajlae%2FbrHRoqJmq6Cksq2%2F06uYZpmjYrWk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./144868-patrisse-cullors-net-worth-age-husband-movies-tv-shows-profiles.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Patrisse Cullors' net worth, age, husband, movies and TV shows, profiles</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./getting-very-little-rain-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Getting very little rain</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-roger-miller-from-coronado-racist-husband-and-wife-from-linfield-christian-school-viral-on.html>Who Is Roger Miller From Coronado?
