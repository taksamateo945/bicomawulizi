He was limited to six games and struggled mightily even when he played, going 1-5 and completing 67.5 percent of his passes for 909 yards, two touchdowns and six interceptions.</p><p>Despite his poor play, the G-Men are essentially locked into having Jones on the roster this season due to his <a href=# rel=noopener>$47.1 million salary cap hit</a> after signing a four-year, $160 million contract extension last offseason.</p><p>By not promising Wilson the starting job, it seems as though the Giants want to at least give Jones a chance to start in 2024 as well with Howe noting that Jones is the "expected" starter.</p><p>Jones won't be without competition, though, as the Giants signed former Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Drew Lock in free agency. Also, SNY's <a href=# rel=noopener>Connor Hughes</a> reported Friday that league sources believe New York is targeting Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy in the first round of the 2024 NFL draft.</p><p>As for the 35-year-old Wilson, he landed on his feet following his release after two seasons in Denver.</p>93.7 The Fan <span class=acct>@937theFan</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>There are 6 trophies in there, time to go get a 7th &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Steelers?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Steelers&lt;/a> QB Russell Wilson &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZYPUtkRGam">pic.twitter.com/ZYPUtkRGam&lt;/a></p><p>Since the Broncos are required to pay him $38 million after cutting him, Wilson took a huge discount to sign with the Steelers, <a href=# rel=noopener>inking</a> a one-year, $1.21 million deal.</p><p>There was some thought that Wilson would have to compete with 2022 first-round pick Kenny Pickett for the starting job, but the competition ended before it started Friday with Pickett getting traded to the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Now, Wilson will have a chance to start in Pittsburgh and build on a Hall of Fame résumé that already includes nine Pro Bowl selections and a Super Bowl win.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWh%2FdX6Mp52lZaKqurC%2B0maeopmeqcBuw86uo52mpGK9s7vMoqqeZaKqwLSxy6VksKGcqLyvec%2BlmLKhnpx6tbXMnmSdraKeu6h5wqilraqRmMFuwMCloqw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./porsha-williams-sends-prayers-to-the-families-of-murdered-children-see-her-sad-post-413820.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Porsha Williams Sends Prayers To The Families Of Murdered Children See Her Sad Post</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mary-scheer-pets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mary Scheer Pets - Celebrity Pets</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-roger-miller-from-coronado-racist-husband-and-wife-from-linfield-christian-school-viral-on.html>Who Is Roger Miller From Coronado?
