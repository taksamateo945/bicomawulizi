I don't want to draw any conclusions yet but things certainly don't look good.&nbsp;</p><p>Let's begin with the offense. Chad Pennington is down and out leaving the unexperienced Chad Henne under center. The one thing that the offense prided itself on last year has not been done, turnovers hurt the Dolphins in week 1 and this week especially by the goal line as coach Sparano said "That is a sin!". They don't take advantage of opportunities and they keep settling for field goals. Just overall frustrating.</p><p>The Defense, oh boy what happened here? Stop the run, get a sack and give up 3rd and long. Can't be doing that. Too many gigantic plays are being allowed. It's tough to win when your defense constantly gives up 50 yard plays. Only one takeaway in three games can't happen either. Not only is the offense not helping the turnover margin the defense can't take advantage of opportunities either. Too many times has a pickable pass slipped through someone's hands or left alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally last but certainly not least in my list of problems with the Dolphins this year the coaching staff particularly the play calling. Drive 94 yards running the ball use the wildcat and pickup yards then in the red zone, hell let's throw the ball because we all know we can't run the ball consistently. Dan Henning is trying to be too creative and too tricky. If they can't stop it keep doing it. If you feel like it run the wildcat all game or run the no huddle all game our opponents haven't been able to stop either of them. The defensive play calling I suppose isn't as horrible or at least not as blatant but one thing, if you're playing man by the goal line, keep a spy linebacker to watch the quarterback that was a real glaring mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>How to fix it? I don't know how to I'll be honest but I will point out four things that need changing in my conclusion. Number one, no more turnovers. Number two, keep doing what works. Number three don't blow coverage. Number four get into the end zone don't kick field goals. Anything can happen although I don't expect a miracle from the Dolphins this year I will continue to analyze their play.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9qZWmGbsPHmqtmoJGlvaa6xJ1kraddqbWmec%2BhoKer</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./coup-group-nyt-crossword-puzzle-clue-1257526.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Coup group NYT Crossword Puzzle Clue</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rush-rush-singer-paula-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rush Rush singer Paula</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-roger-miller-from-coronado-racist-husband-and-wife-from-linfield-christian-school-viral-on.html>Who Is Roger Miller From Coronado?
