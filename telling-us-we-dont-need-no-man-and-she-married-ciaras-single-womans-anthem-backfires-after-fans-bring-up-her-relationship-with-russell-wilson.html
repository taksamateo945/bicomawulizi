Can’t wait for this to drop.”</p><p>Although the Texas-born, Georgia-raised singer received love on her page, there were several comments under The Shade Room’s re-posted <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> that questioned why Ciara was creating an anthem about being single when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">she’s seemingly in a happy</a> and healthy relationship with Denver Broncos quarterback, Russell Wilson.</p><p>“Ma’am, you have a very wealthy and successful husband. What are you talking about?”</p><p>“This is for the girls who don’t need no man, meanwhile she happily married.”</p><p>“Not her telling us we don’t need no man and she married after her prayer.”</p><p>A few fans defended the Grammy award-winning artist by breaking down their own belief about the song’s meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>“This message isn’t for single girls. It’s for women that don’t need a man. Married women are out there getting it too. A good relationship is just a bonus.”</p><p>“Do people not realize these artist job is to make music for ‘THE PEOPLE’ she doesn’t have to relate!! It’s for the girls who can relate to JAM OUT TO DUH I hate the world just live to find negativity in every single thing! It’s like telling an actor not to ACT, how would that sound?”</p><p>Ciara and Wilson met in 2015 at a Wisconsin basketball game during March Madness. Sparks quickly flew after which prompted the Denver Broncos player to ask her on a date.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You’re the Best Part <a href=#>@DangeRussWilson</a><br>I love you so much my sweet <a href=#>#Valentine</a>❤️❤️❤️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vCRd9efDt0</a></p>— Ciara (@ciara) <a href=#>February 15, 2023</a></figure><p>“Next thing I know, it was 12:00 a.m, 12:30 a.m and I was sold on you,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recalled</a> in a 2020 Instagram Live.&nbsp;</p><p>Wilson and Ciara tied the knot in 2016 and gradually became one of Hollywood’s fan-favorite couples. In 2017, the pair welcomed their first child together, 5-year-old Sienna Princess Wilson, and three years later welcomed their second child together, 2-year-old Win Harrison Wilson.&nbsp;</p><p>Ciara also has an 8-year-old son, Future Zahir Wilburn, from her previous relationship with rapper Future.
