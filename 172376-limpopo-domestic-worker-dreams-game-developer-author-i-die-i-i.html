The 40-year-old tells <strong>Briefly News</strong> about her journey, future ambitions and love of writing.</p><h2>Limpopo woman had a tough childhood</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chireki </a>is a writer and publishes stories on various platforms, including the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fundza Literacy Trust</a>. She dreams of having a book published and for her stories to reach a bigger platform:</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <i>Have you recorded a funny video or filmed the moment of fame, cool dance, or something bizarre? Inbox your personal video on our <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook page</a>!</i></strong></p>“When I started, I was typing my stories on a Nokia. I hope to buy my own laptop one day and currently use someone else’s.”<p class=align-left>When the woman was only in Grade 5, she was sexually assaulted, and instead of receiving comfort and care, she was scorned by her family members. This and various other traumatic events <a href=#>inspire her writing</a>:</p>“I never trusted a person, so writing opened a friend for me who listened when I wrote. I didn’t feel judged, and when I wrote, I felt better.”<p class=align-left>Chireki is a highly imaginative and talented author. She writes about love, witchcraft and more, garnering inspiration from nature and the <a href=#>people</a> she meets, among other things:</p>“I usually like writing after having an adventure. I go to places with scenery to find ideas there. I can even go shopping to clear my mind and get a story by just looking around. Some stories are based on true events.”<h2>Domestic worker wants to be gamer</h2><p class=align-left>In addition to her aptitude for writing, the mom also<a href=#> loves information technology</a> and wants to be a gamer:</p>“I hold qualifications in Computer Science from Bern Equipment College but could not further my education since I needed to take care of my children.“My other dream is to publish my books. I have some on Amazon, but I have real stories about my life that I need to get a publisher to help me publicise. Initially, I just wrote to imagine a better life.”<p class=align-left>Chireki has faced so much in life, including illness, heartbreak, struggle and rejection, but notes that <a href=#>her faith keeps her strong</a>:</p>“God keeps me motivated and I have friends who push me to pursue my dreams. Now I am learning computer languages, such as Python. I do what I love and I am working hard to achieve my dreams. Even if I die, I know I tried.”<h2>Domestic worker reflects on graduation</h2><p class=align-left>In another inspiring story, <strong>Briefly News</strong> previously wrote about a single mother of four from Gauteng who is incredibly emotional after <a href=#>obtaining her degree</a> in an applied psychology-related field from <a href=#>Unisa</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The domestic worker overcame so many struggles to bag her degree without any funding while working full-time to support her kids.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop6yp7jYZ5qoZqqWfLGxzqmjnmenpLqmuo5qbmtrZ2t6rbXMqaapp12ZvK6x0q2gnGWnpL%2BssdFmm6udkaLAbrPAppxmnJWrsq27z56pZpmlqbWwvoyiZJ2hlWK2brWO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./damon-thomas-net-worth-wife-house.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Damon Thomas Net Worth, Wife, House</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./know-about-carl-hagelin-wife-stats-contract-wedding-capitals.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Know About Carl Hagelin; Wife, Stats, Contract, Wedding, Capitals</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-roger-miller-from-coronado-racist-husband-and-wife-from-linfield-christian-school-viral-on.html>Who Is Roger Miller From Coronado?
