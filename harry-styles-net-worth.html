Born February 1, 1994 to Anne Cox and Desmond Styles in Redditch, Worcestershire in the United Kingdom, he is one of the young men that make up the very famous boy band One Direction. He is one of two children, growing up with an older sister by the name of Gemma. Throughout his childhood, Styles was an avid fan of singers such as Freddie Mercury and The Beatles, and he spent as much time as possible singing. During his time at the Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School after his parents divorced when he was only seven, he was part of a boy band that went by the name White Eskimo. The band actually won a few local competitions.</p><p>However, this is now what would make Harry Styles famous. Rather, it was his solo audition on a hit show known as the X Factor that caught the attention of the guest judge, former Pussy Cat Doll Nicole Scherzinger. When Styles was not able to progress to the next round of the competition after being eliminated, she suggested that he, along with four other boys from his age range that did not make it to the next stage, form a group and attempt to qualify for that stage of the competition. He and the other four other boys, as they were in 2010, formed a boy band that Styles named One Direction, and began competing together.</p><p>Host Simon Cowell felt that there was something quite special about the group, and he chose them. Before long, the third place finishers were signed to Cowell’s label and were making an album. The rest, as they say, is history. One Direction hit the waves like a ton of bricks and has not looked back since, even though one of the young men in the group decided he would leave in 2015. Styles has spent the past five years working on his career, and he has not had much time to have a personal life. However, after he was eliminated from the singing competition, he began a relationship with Caroline Flack, the presenter on the hit television show. He dated her for three months before their 14-year age difference became too much of a problem. He later dated famous singer Taylor Swift, who allegedly wrote several songs about him.</p><p>In addition to his singing career, which has been undoubtedly successful, Harry Styles is also credited for writing many of the band’s hit songs. He is very talented as both a singer and a songwriter, and he has managed to earn his net worth solely from his musical career. One Direction is still a fairly new and very young group that has plans to do far more as the years go by, and we don’t doubt he will one day pursue a solo career of his own, which will likely only help him to increase his already significant net worth to an even higher number.</p><p>Photo via Getty</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGifmqqirnq0wNilnKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10021326-mario-goodrich-nfl-draft-2022-scouting-report-for-clemson-cb.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mario Goodrich NFL Draft 2022: Scouting Report for Clemson CB | News, Scores, Highlights, Stats, and</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-great-balls-of-fire-lyrics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Great Balls Of Fire Lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-roger-miller-from-coronado-racist-husband-and-wife-from-linfield-christian-school-viral-on.html>Who Is Roger Miller From Coronado?
